# Derek-Stepper-Library
I created this Arduino library to learn how stepper motors worked.  I am only posting this here so I can access my library remotely.  I do not understand how Github works, but if anyone finds this, just realize there are probably better libraries out there for this same purpose.  I have used this library with the following stepper drivers: A4988, DRV8825, and TB6600.
